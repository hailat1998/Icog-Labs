Economic Attention Networks (ECANs) is a resource allocation and associative memory system implemented within the OpenCog AGI framework, designed as a nonlinear dynamical system similar to Hopfield nets but with unique economic model characteristics. The system's core architecture includes a graph-based implementation using untyped nodes and links, specifically HebbianLink and InverseHebbianLink types, where each Atom (nodes and links) carries STI (short-term importance) and LTI (long-term importance) weights functioning as artificial currencies within a conservation-based economic model. The OpenCog implementation features an AtomTable repository, CogServer for system management, and specialized MindAgents for HebbianLinkUpdating and ImportanceUpdating, working alongside other cognitive processes like PLN and MOSES. The system introduces AttentionalFocus (AF) containing high-STI Atoms, manages resource allocation through a central bank-like CogServer, and implements a forgetting mechanism for low-LTI Atoms, all while maintaining distinct architectural differences from traditional neural networks as it's specifically engineered for AGI purposes rather than brain emulation.
